# Journaling Application Testing Outline

This document outlines a testing strategy for the journaling application, covering frontend, backend API, and the media processing pipeline. Due to the limitations of the WebContainer environment, actual automated tests are not fully executable here. This outline provides a guide for setting up tests in a complete development environment.

## 1. Frontend Testing (React Application)

### Areas to Test:

*   **Journaling Interface:**
    *   Text entry: Verify text input and handling.
    *   Media upload: Test file selection and handling (placeholder in WebContainer, actual upload to be tested in a real browser environment).
    *   GPS capture: Mock geolocation API to simulate location capture.
    *   Offline storage (IndexedDB):
        *   Saving entries offline.
        *   Retrieving entries offline.
        *   Data persistence across sessions.
*   **Video Dashboard:**
    *   Video preview: Verify video player integration and placeholder video display.
    *   Publish options: Test button interactions and placeholder API calls for publishing.

### Testing Methods:

*   **Manual Testing (in Browser):**
    *   **Journaling Interface:**
        1.  Open the React app in a browser.
        2.  Enter text in the journal entry field.
        3.  Attempt to upload media files (verify file selection UI).
        4.  Simulate geolocation (using browser dev tools if possible, or mock in code for testing).
        5.  Save an entry.
        6.  Verify the entry is saved and displayed in the entries list.
        7.  Go offline (disable network in browser dev tools).
        8.  Create a new entry offline.
        9.  Go back online and verify both entries are still present (offline persistence).
    *   **Video Dashboard:**
        1.  Navigate to the video dashboard.
        2.  Verify the video preview player is displayed (with placeholder video).
        3.  Click publish buttons (YouTube, TikTok) and verify placeholder alerts/console logs.

*   **Unit Tests (using Jest/React Testing Library - *Conceptual Outline*):**
    *   Component-level tests for JournalingForm, VideoPreview, PublishOptions, etc.
    *   Mock API calls and browser APIs (like Geolocation, IndexedDB).
    *   Test UI interactions and state updates.

*   **Integration Tests (using Cypress/Selenium - *Conceptual Outline*):**
    *   End-to-end flows for creating journal entries, viewing recaps, and triggering publish actions.
    *   Test interactions between components and simulated backend API.

### Placeholder Test Files (Conceptual - Not Executable in WebContainer):

*(Conceptual structure - create these files in a real React project)*

```
src/components/JournalingForm.test.tsx  // Unit tests for JournalingForm component
src/components/VideoPreview.test.tsx    // Unit tests for VideoPreview component
src/components/PublishOptions.test.tsx   // Unit tests for PublishOptions component
src/App.test.tsx                       // Integration tests for main App component flows
```

## 2. Backend API Testing (Node.js/Express)

### Areas to Test:

*   **Entry Creation (POST /entries):**
    *   Valid data submission (text, location, media).
    *   Handling missing data.
    *   Error handling (database errors, file upload errors - *placeholder in WebContainer*).
*   **Entry Retrieval (GET /entries):**
    *   Retrieving all entries.
    *   Handling no entries.
    *   Error handling (database errors).

### Testing Methods:

*   **Manual Testing (using `curl` or Postman):**
    1.  Start the Node.js API server.
    2.  Use `curl` or Postman to send POST requests to `/entries` with different data payloads (valid, invalid, missing fields).
    3.  Verify successful entry creation (status 201) and error responses (status 400, 500).
    4.  Use `curl` or browser to send GET requests to `/entries`.
    5.  Verify successful retrieval of entries (status 200) and correct data format.

*   **Integration Tests (using Jest/Supertest - *Conceptual Outline*):**
    *   Endpoint tests for `/entries` (POST and GET).
    *   Mock MongoDB interactions (using `mongodb-memory-server` or similar for isolated testing).
    *   Test request/response formats and data validation.

### Placeholder Test Files (Conceptual - Not Executable in WebContainer):

*(Conceptual structure - create these files in a real Node.js project)*

```
test/entries.test.js // Integration tests for /entries API endpoints
```

## 3. Media Processing Pipeline Testing (Node.js Script - `recap.js`)

### Areas to Test:

*   **Data Retrieval:**
    *   Fetching recent entries from MongoDB.
    *   Handling cases with no recent entries.
*   **Map Generation (Placeholder):**
    *   Verify static map URL generation logic (placeholder function).
*   **Video Generation (Placeholder):**
    *   Simulate FFmpeg command execution and verify placeholder output.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Database connection errors.
    *   API errors (Google Maps - *placeholder*).
    *   FFmpeg errors (*placeholder*).

### Testing Methods:

*   **Unit Tests (using Jest/Mocha - *Conceptual Outline*):**
    *   Test individual functions in `recap.js` (data retrieval, map URL generation, video generation simulation).
    *   Mock MongoDB and external API calls.

*   **Manual Testing (Script Execution and Output Verification):**
    1.  Run `node recap.js` script.
    2.  Verify console logs for each step (MongoDB connection, data retrieval, map URL, video generation simulation).
    3.  Check for any error messages in the console output.
    4.  In a real environment, you would verify the generated map image and video file.

### Placeholder Test Files (Conceptual - Not Executable in WebContainer):

*(Conceptual structure - create these files in a real Node.js project)*

```
test/recap.test.js // Unit tests for recap.js script functions
```

## Potential Issues and Optimizations (Based on Development and Testing Outline):

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Media Handling:**  Actual media file handling and display in React components needs implementation (beyond basic file upload UI).
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement more robust error handling in React components (e.g., for geolocation failures, IndexedDB errors).
*   **Backend API:**
    *   **Azure Blob Storage Integration:** Implement actual file upload to Azure Blob Storage and URL retrieval in the `/entries` POST endpoint.
    *   **Data Validation:** Add more comprehensive data validation for request bodies in API endpoints.
    *   **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization for API endpoints in a production environment.
*   **Media Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Google Maps API and FFmpeg Integration:** Replace placeholder functions with actual Google Maps Static API calls and FFmpeg command execution.
    *   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement detailed error handling and logging in `recap.js` for production monitoring.
    *   **Performance:** Optimize video generation process for efficiency, especially if handling large media files or frequent processing.

This outline provides a comprehensive approach to testing the journaling application. Remember that in WebContainer, you are limited to manual testing and conceptual test structures. For full automated testing and real-world deployment, you would need to set up a complete development environment with appropriate testing frameworks and cloud service integrations.
